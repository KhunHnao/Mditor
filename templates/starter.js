## Welcome to Mditor!

Mditor uses a simple formatting language called Markdown (hence the creativity in the name). It can be used as a place to keep notes for later or to create simple sharable sites that anyone can access. Mditor is an open-source application whose source code can be found on [Github](https://github.com/khunhnao/mditor). It's free, now and forever.
